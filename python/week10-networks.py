Programming Group week 10: Networks

Tasks: 

1 - Get some tweets (source? doesn't matter... Let's pick something we think will be good for:)
2 - Go over all tweets, find those that are retweets (remember: functions in utility.py)
3 - Store all retweet data: who retweeted who.
4 - Make a network: nodes = users, links = retweets. Weight? Number of retweets...
5 - Visualize the network
6 - Do some networky stuff...

How to make networks? Python has an incredible library: networkx
(it's already installed. Try 'import networkx')
