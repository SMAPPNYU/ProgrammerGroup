Basic commands to access a mongodb database (10/01/2013)

For each command, I will give an explanation and general form, followed by a specific example
(unless there is no form and the command simply requires you to type something and hit enter).
NOTE: this means you should only execute the SECOND command in an example, not the first.

1. Connect to the database server

mongo HOSTNAME:PORT
mongo smapp.politics.fas.nyu.edu:27011

NOTE to WINDOWS users: there is a way to add the mongo program to your "path" (so that it can be
run from anywhere on your command prompt). I'll write about this soon. For now, use the full path
to the mongo program:

C:\mongodb-2.4.6\bin\mongo HOSTNAME:PORT


2. Connect to a specific database on the server

mongo HOSTNAME:PORT/DATABASE
mongo smapp.politics.fas.nyu.edu:27011/Syria


Once connected, these command may be executed in the mongo "shell" (the '>' prompt you'll see)

3. See what database you're currently "using"

db

4. Change your active database

use DATABASE
use test

5. Authorize yourself ("log in") so you can see collections of data

db.auth("USERNAME", "PASSWORD")
db.auth("readonly", "<super secret password here>")

6. See what collections (sets of data) are in the database

show collections

7. Count the number of items in a collection

db.COLLECTION.count()
db.sample_data.count()
